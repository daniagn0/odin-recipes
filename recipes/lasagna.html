        <p>The best lasagna you'll ever make!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef </li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li> <br>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li><br>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>All the flavors of traditional cordon bleu but keto friendly and much easier to assemble since there is no stuffing or rolling involved.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>⅔ cup almond flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup avocado oil</li>
            <li>¼ pound shaved deli ham</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; set aside.</li> <br>

            <li>Whisk eggs and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Combine almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken cutlets into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge with almond flour mixture, then set on a plate.</li><br>

            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices are running clear, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li><br>

            <li>Place chicken cutlets on a baking sheet. Top with slices of ham and cover with shredded Swiss cheese.</li><br>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li><br>
